pylangparser - Simple language parsing from Python. Project provides classes
for parsing formal languages in an easy way. Without using any external
libraries, only unittest, re and pprint. There is a Lexer and a Parser class.
The lexer produces list of tokens that the Parser then uses to build the AST.
The lexer can also be used as a stand alone component. There is support for
building customized ASTâ€™s. The grammars are defined directly into the Python
code.

In the examples folder you will find both simple example scripts demonstrating
basic usage of the parser and some more useful and complex ones. For example,
there is a script for parsing C source code and building and iterating the AST.
SQL parser will be added soon too.

Note: Documentation is not fully complete yet. Existing APIs can still change.
