# pylangparser - provides classes for parsing formal languages
# in an easy way. There is a Lexer and a Parser. The lexer produces
# list of tokens that the Parser uses to build the AST. The lexer
# can also be used as a stand alone component.
# The grammars are defined directly in the Python code. For details,
# check the unit tests and the examples.
#
# Note: the parser is under development and is not included in the
# source yet.
