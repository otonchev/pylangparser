pylangparser - provides classes for parsing formal languages in an easy way.

No external libraries are used.

There is a Lexer and a Parser. The lexer produces list of tokens that the Parser
then uses to build the AST. The lexer can also be used as a stand alone component.
The grammars are defined directly into the Python code. For details, check the
examples.

There is an example script for parsing C source code and building AST.

Note: the Parser is functional but still under development.
Documentation is not complete yet. New APIs for building custom ASTs will be added soon.
