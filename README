pylangparser - Simple language parsing from Python. Project provides classes
for parsing formal languages in an easy way. Without using any external
libraries, only unittest, re and pprint. There is a Lexer and a Parser class.
The lexer produces list of tokens that the Parser then uses to build the AST.
The lexer can also be used as a stand alone component.
The grammars are defined directly into the Python code.

In the examples folder you will find some simple example scripts
demonstrating basic usage of the parser plus some more useful and complex
ones. For example, there is a script for parsing C source code and building
and iterating the AST.

Project's wiki page:

Note: the Parser is functional but still under development. Documentation is
not complete yet. New APIs for building custom ASTs will be added soon.
